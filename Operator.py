  # Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# Arithmetic operators

# a=6
# y=5
# sum=(a+y)
# sub=(a-y)
# mul=(a*y)
# div=(a/y)

# print(sum)
# print(sub)
# print(mul)
# print(div)


# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:


# 1. Basic Assignment (=)
# This assigns a value to a variable:

# x = 10
# print(x)


# 2. Add and Assign (+=)
# Adds a value to the current value of the variable and assigns the result back:

# x = 5
# x += 3  
# print(x)


# 3. Subtract and Assign (-=)
# # Subtracts a value from the current value and assigns the result:

# x = 10
# x -= 4  
# print(x) 




# # Bitwise AND Assign (&=)
# # Performs a bitwise AND operation and assigns the result:


# x = 6  
# x &= 3 
# print(x)




# Bitwise OR Assign (|=)
# Performs a bitwise OR operation and assigns the result:

# x = 4 
# x |= 1  
# print(x)
